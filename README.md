# Pass the parcel
This repository contains simulation models and data associated with the paper "Smoothly pass the parcel: implementing the theory of swift, even flow" by W. Garn, J. Aitken and R. Schmenner.

The above-mentioned paper explains the Discrete Event Simulation models (sc-to-be.doe and sc-as-is.doe) and their insights. The models were implemented using the software [Arena](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-gb/products/software/arena-simulation/buying-options/download.html#register-download).
